In phil-rightfork: 
I tried more than 10 times with input 2 2. Majority of the times
it does not work. It generate a dead lock as soon as two philiphors picks up right forks.
However, sometimes, the program will come to an end. And I suspect that it could be another program 
initiate an interupt to block the current thread and it will essentially make the program come to an end.
The reason that rightfork will come to an deadlock is that if everyone picks the right fork, they will 
all wait for the left fork and that is impossible to run.


In phil-ordered:
I tried more than 10 times with input 10,10, 11,11, 10,11, etc. 
Essentially, the program will come to an end with even number of philiphors but will not come to and
an end with odd number of philiphors.

In phil-random:
I tried more than 10 time with input like 100,100 10,10 20,20 and so on, found out that for even numbers
of philiphors, the program runs without a problem. But when given an odd number of philiphors, the last 
philiphor keeps giving up.
