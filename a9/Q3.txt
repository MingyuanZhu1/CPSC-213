The real running time follows:
sRead > tRead > aRead
tRead is slower than sRead because it handles reads and writes sequentially.
tRead is faster than aRead because it has multiple threads to handle the data.

The system running time follows:
tRead > sRead = aRead
tRead is slower than both sRead and aRead because it needs to create multiple threads.
Thus, more time is needed.
