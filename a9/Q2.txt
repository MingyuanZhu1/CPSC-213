aRead performs better compare to sRead. This is because in aRead, it sets off multiple disk reads at once.
Thus, CPU does not have to wait before each read is done to continue. Consequently, even though it looks like
the performance is similiar in aRead 10 and aRead 100, it does inprove significantly in aRead 1000.
